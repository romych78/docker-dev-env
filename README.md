# docker-dev-env
My  development environment based on Docker containers, used docker compose as a manager.

Docker and docker-compose have to be installed first.

Please fix configuration files first.

In this configuration included 
- web: apache2 + PHP5.4
- db: Percona
- Redis
- Mongo
- Solr 3.6
- Gearman
